def get_permutations(sequence):
    '''
    Enumerate all permutations of a given string

    sequence (string): an arbitrary string to permute. Assume that it is a
    non-empty string.  

    You MUST use recursion for this part. Non-recursive solutions will not be
    accepted.

    Returns: a list of all permutations of sequence

    Example:
    >>> get_permutations('abc')
    ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']

    Note: depending on your implementation, you may return the permutations in
    a different order than what is listed here.
